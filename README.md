## Setup
1. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
2. Open the newly created .env file and set the values for the following environment variables:
```
RINNA_URE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your_rinna_ure_subscription_key_here
URE_KNOWLEDGE_SET_ID=your_ure_knowledge_set_id_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
3. Once the edits are complete, save the file. The program will use this file to load the environment variables when it runs.
